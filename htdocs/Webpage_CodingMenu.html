				<h2 class="codemenu_h2"> Python </h2>
				<p class="codemenu_p"> Python is one of the coding languages that I learned, and it is the very first that I was taught. It is a 				high-level programming language, and is very versatile. I started being talk about this programming language when 			I was in grade 7 because it was part of the curriculum. I remember during that time I really hated anything that 			dealt with programming when I was learning Python. </p>

				<h2 class="codemenu_h2"> C++ </h2>
				<p class="codemenu_p"> C++ is the second coding language that I learned. It is a high-level programming language, and is also very 
				versatile. This programming language was introduced to me when I was in grade 8. The experience when learning this 			programming was fun yet challenging. Unlike Python which I learned before, this was an up in the amount of syntax 			I have to remember. Loops in c++ were always fun to make. Before I would spend most of my time figuring out how 			the output is wrong by manually solving the expected output that my code will give each loop. </p>

				<h2 class="codemenu_h2"> HAXE </h2>
				<p class="codemenu_p"> HAXE is the third coding language that I learned. a high-level, cross-platform programming language and compiler 
					that can be used to build applications for various platforms such as web, desktop, and mobile.Though I dabbled with it, Stencyl,
					which uses Haxe, was the one that I coded in more. Stencyl is the application that I used to build my game.

				<h1 class="exp_h1"> Python</h1>
				<p class="exp_p"> Shout out to Sir Anthony for teaching Python to me!
				Python was the introduction and my eye opener to the world of coding. Opening me to the stress and the satisfaction during the overall coding experience. 
				I was struggling learning with Python during my first year since I was still getting used to it. My favorite part was learning how to be able to code using
				turtle extension. It brought a sense of satisfaction whenever the turtle would print out what it needed to print.

				<h1 class="exp_h1"> C++</h1>
				<p class="exp_p"> Shout out to Sir for teaching C++ to me!
				This has been the number tear giver to me during grade 8. Coding using C++ has made me stress and want to pull out my hair multiple times, but it is also the
				the coding language that I am most comfortable coding with. I remember every assessment where the first and hardest part of doing it, is first thinking of how
				to approach the problem. Do you code the main first? Do you code the function?, and what makes it further interesting is how in different problems, there are
				multiple ways where you can solve it. From simple to complex.

				<h1 class="exp_h1"> HTML </h1>
				<p class="exp_p"> Shout out to the pinakapogi Sir Jimmy for teaching HTML to me!
				My experience while learning HTML and additionally CSS has been fun so far. It was interesting to be able to make my own website from what sir Jimmy and W3Schools 
				taught me to make this Website. Though ofcourse there has also been stressful times when trying to debug what was wrong with the webpage,but Inspect page has
				become my bestfriend during those times. </p>

				<h1 class="exp_h1"> Haxe/Stencyl </h1>
				<p class="exp_p"> Shout out to Ma'am Dawn for introducing it to me in SUDO, and my fellow SUDO seniors who helped me understand it!
				Special thanks to Youtube who was always there to give a tutorial on "how to" when giving up seemed like the better option. </p>
